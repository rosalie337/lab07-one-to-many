# LAB: Exploring Models with One-to-Many

Create an express application that uses your models. Implement basic CRUD routes.

## Requirements

Create at least two model and all CRUD routes for those models. Your models should
have a one-to-many relationship. For the `findById` on the one side use a `JOIN`. 
Test your routes with [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest).

## Rubric

* CRUD routes for your model (2 points)
* JOIN on findById (5 points)
* test CRUD routes (3 points)
